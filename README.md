to use google's services in China, we can point them to beijing IP to fuck the G~F~W, the simplest way is to use hosts file, but hosts file is not dynamic, and regex match is not supported.

This simple dnsproxy is written to solve this problem.

It'w rewritten from my ns course, which requests that we use TCP for outgoing query. I will change this back to UDP later.
